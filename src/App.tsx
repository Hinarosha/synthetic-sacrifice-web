The gameplay mechanic will be very simple : Move your characterwoth the standard movement controls. Interact with a character or an item to open a context menu that will opperate as an interaction menu. You can for exemple, hen interracting with an item, see it's stats, add to your inventory or equip it directly. For the character you could for exemple Talk, fight or anaylze.   
An XP system that would allow the character to get better cybernetics through an upgrade tree. XP is earned through main quests, side quests and fights. 
Different weapons are lootable, purchasable or even granted through finishing some quests. Those weapons have different statistics. Melee weapons such as katana, or firearms from handguns to big sniper rifles and massive machine guns. 
Through the choices that the player made during the game he could see 7 different endings.  
There will be endgame content that are basically side quests so that the player can keep getting upgrades until he's strong enough to beat the final optional boss.`,

They're leaning against the cold wall of an abandoned ripper doc clinic, barely holding on. With no other choice, they drag themselves inside. The place is a wreck. Broken tools, shattered screens, and cybernetic parts scattered across the floor. In the center, an old cybernetic installation chair is found and it looks like it's still working somehow. The player pulls themselves into the seat and activates it. 
Metal arms clamp down. The machine forcefully installs cybernetic ports where their limbs used to be. The pain is unbearable, unlike anything a human should endure. Their body convulses, vision blurs, and then everything goes black. 
When they come back to life, they feel… empty. Their mind is a blank slate. No past, no memories. 
Just pain. 
They struggle to move, dragging themselves forward with their one remaining arm, leaving a smear of blood on the floor. Then, among the wreckage, they spot a discarded cyber-leg. It's dented, rusted but it's their only chance. 
They jam it into their leg port. A violent shock tears through their body as the nerve link connects. Their vision darkens for a moment. The leg twitches, unresponsive at first, but slowly, it obeys. 
It's rough, but it works. They push themselves up, unsteady but standing. 
They don't know who they are. They don't know what happened. But they're alive. And they need to keep moving.`,

You have to beat all of the guards with your crew, many NPC that you might have bound to die. At this point you get to Z and start the fight with him. 

The big contract. 
As a mercenary you get offered a contract where you have to kill Z. You can refuse the contract to have a path where you ignore Z. If you accept, you get a call from him. If you choose to kill Grim, Z will offer to join him. Accepting to join Z will result in the lowest honor ending of the game (The corpo sellout). The player can also just not answer the call or insult him or even be nonchalant about it as he's just a contract. Depending on the choices during the game, the fight will be more or less hard. If you lose the fight against him, Z will insert the soul killer into your neural port, trapping your soul into a relic forever. If you win the fight he tries to offer you a very good position in his company. The player can accept and get the low honor ending or he can give him the final strike.`,

Confidential information involving different other corporations then gets leaked and the whole city starts to join the rebels, leaving V-city to the hands of its population and democracy comes back. 

Contract done. 
The point of the contract was not only to kill Z but also to erase all the proof involving some other company into weird business. The following choice is to either execute the contract and erase everything or leave the city a chance by leaving all the evidence for the rebels to find. This will only work if you havent had to kill all the rebels of course. You now have tons shit of money and equipment. You can decide to do anything you want as no one can stop you anymore.

-	Conditions: Don't Side with the Rebels, Kill Grim, Side with Z.

2. The Rebel Leader 
-	Conditions: Side with the Rebels, Spare Grim, kill Z. 
-	Outcome: You lead a revolution against the corpos. The city is freed, democracy is back and a bright future can be seen. 

3. The Lone Wolf 
-	Conditions: don't side with the rebels, kill Grim Fang, ignore Z. 
-	Outcome: The rebels start a huge battle and most of them die to the corpo forces. You become a wanderer mercenary with no honor. The last rebels standing push you out of the city, leaving you in an endless desert outside the city where all you can do is fight against all the unwelcoming cyberpsychos there. 

4. The Sacrificial Hero 
-	Conditions: Side with the rebels, sparing Grim Fang, try to kill Z but lose. 
-	Outcome: You lose your fight with Z, but Grim Fang comes out of nowhere surprisingly stabbing Z leaving you the opportunity to finally rip Z's head off but Z escapes at that right moment and your blade decapitates Grim's head. Though the rage almost turns you psycho, a second fight starts where your abilities are multiplied by 2, granting you an easy win.   

5. The Cyberpsycho 
-	Conditions: Overuse cybernetic upgrades. 
-	Outcome: You become a cyberpsycho, you can't interact with anyone or it'll start a fight where you can't control yourself. Your only choice is to kill everyone and maybe even kill Z. 

6. The unexpected savior 
-	Conditions : Don't join the rebels, spare Grim Fang, kill Z 
-	Outcome: As mercenary, you get a contract to kill Z. You go there and find out that the rebels are trying to infiltrate the building. They are in a difficult position as they're all dying. But since you have a contract to accomplish you help them and kill Z while they fight the guards. They are grateful. 

7. The hated 
-	Conditions : Don't join the rebels, kill Grim Fang, kill Z 
-	Outcome: As mercenary, you get a contract to kill Z. You go there and find out that the rebels are trying to infiltrate the building. They are in a difficult position as they're all dying. When you get there a group of rebels recognize you and try to kill you. You defend yourself and end up having to kill all of them.

- Von Beber: He is a former train driver turned mad by the recurring suicides in the city metro. He fell into synthetic drug addiction, is very mentally unstable and can either be a friend or a foe to the main character depending on his choices. 

- Anti-brodu : He is a washed-up ex-hacker, paranoid and always on edge, but his parrot is the real mastermind. Fitted with a neural uplink and a modified voice synthesizer, the parrot is an elite-level hacker, capable of infiltrating even the most secure networks. Anti-brodu treats him like an old war buddy, constantly arguing with the bird as if they were equals. Whether they help or betray the player depends on how much trust they have in them.  

- Queen Karen : Has perfected the use of ancient hacking technologies. He became a lone wolf refusing to use the newer technology and never got augmented. He developed cancer and lost his mind. He can give very useful hacking techniques to the player.`,

His backstory is that he was employed and then forcely augmented by his both to become the strongest bodyguard but ended up killing his boss to become a lonely mercenary. (inspiration : Adam Smasher from Cyberpunk2077) 

- Halycon-Void : A former military tactician whose mind was forcibly transferred into an advanced combat AI. He retains his genius-level strategy but has lost all emotion. His first phase is all about calculated precision, predicting the player's moves and countering them. In phase two, an internal memory corruption forces him into an unpredictable, chaotic state where his attacks are randomized but devastating. 

- Mournstar: Once the most infamous bounty hunter in the underground, MOURNSTAR was betrayed by the megacorp that employed her and left for dead. Now, she exists only to hunt and kill those who stand in her way. Her first phase is a duel-like encounter where she analyzes the player's patterns. In phase two, she injects herself with a banned combat stimulant, making her reckless, ultra-fast, and immune to status effects. 

- Vulture : A cybernetic scavenger who preys on fallen warriors, absorbing their augments and skills. VULTURE-77 is unpredictable because his skillset depends on the enemies he has devoured before the fight. In phase one, he fights using the stolen techniques of past challengers. When entering phase two, he activates an emergency power surge that lets him use multiple stolen skills per turn, making him a nightmare to predict. 

- Zoren : A genetically enhanced soldier who volunteered to get experimental military-grade cybernetics. Now, his mind is barely human, operating on instinct and raw aggression. His first phase is a brutal but disciplined fight. When his cybernetic limiters break in phase two, he ignores all defensive tactics and prioritizes pure, overwhelming destruction, striking multiple times per turn with no regard for his own safety. 

- Kwerl : He is an old failed scientific experiment to mix human and animal genes. He became a failure as his mind started to be more animal and lost consciousness. He is addicted to virtual reality and becomes extremely aggressive when bothered.`,
